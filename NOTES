This is a cmdline frontend for performing operations on image sequences.

Images load into an ImgSeq object for which Operation objects can operate on.

// cmdline format
procimgseq [First image] [Operation] [Options]

// Input filename conventions
Needs to support following formats for importing image sequences:

No leading 0's:
img1.tga, img2.tga, ..., img25.tga, ...

Leading 0's:
img001.tga, img002.tga, ..., img225.tga, ...

Index numbers should be at beginning or end of filename. 
Numbers before and after are invalid.

// Output filename convention
Always uses sufficient number of leading zeros.
%n character appearing in filename specifies where to place
img%n.tga
gives
img001.tga, img002.tga, ... img100.tga
Image sequences index from 1

If no %n character is specified, the output filename is invalid.

// Operations 
Operations can have set of options
Operations need to be able to also take image sequences as imput
How to make operations extensible???? 

// Timeshift Alg:
timeshift(imgseq, shiftseq) -> output

Confirm imgseq, shiftseq are same dimensions
For i in output:

    Get associated shiftseq image Si
    Create map (shift_dist) -> pix coord
    For each pixel in Si:
        find shift_dist sd
        Add to map
    






Sequence:
    - Use chooses first image, software finds remaining images
    - Find all images in given sequence
    - Ensure all images are similar format (same dimentions, color info...)
        - If they are not, stop the sequence at the first image which doesn't match previous
    - Report to user what range of images were loaded (first and last file, number of files found)
